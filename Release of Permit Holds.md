# Protocols for Release of GARFO permit holds for 2024/2025 year

Each year we must work with the GARFO permit office to ensure dealers submit missing and/or incomplete reports before they have a GARFO permit hold removed.


## Overall Steps in the Process

**1) Emails from Don Paskowski at GARFO**
- **new applications** If Don P. at GARFO receives an application from a dealer that we have requested an HMS Compliance hold on, he will send an email to the team to let us know that we need to follow up with the dealer to see if the issues are resolved
- **Updating GARFO permit hold list** The POC (who can be Jackie unless out of the office, in which case a POC will be identified) will see who is the account manager for the dealer who has submitted an application. The POC will check the google sheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j3tHnC15TjdkqyJfNE7ACX6vx4uoKeccjuscuBjLyuQ/edit?gid=680352385#gid=680352385](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j3tHnC15TjdkqyJfNE7ACX6vx4uoKeccjuscuBjLyuQ/edit?gid=680352385#gid=680352385) and indicate that we have “application in hand” in the “Comments” column
